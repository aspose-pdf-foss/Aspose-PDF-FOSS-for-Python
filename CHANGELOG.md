# Changelog

All notable changes to Aspose.PDF FOSS for Python will be documented in this
file.

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `Document(...)` no longer discards its arguments. It now loads the supplied
  source with the same semantics and errors as `Document.load_from(...)`, and
  rejects unknown arguments, so `Document("input.pdf")` can no longer return an
  empty document. `aspose_pdf.generated.document.Document` gained the same
  signature.
- Compatibility placeholders for unimplemented formats now fail explicitly
  through the new `UnsupportedFeatureException` (also a `NotImplementedError`):
  load options such as `SvgLoadOptions` are rejected by the constructor and
  `load_from()`, and `Document.save(destination, save_format)` rejects
  `SaveFormat.PPTX`, non-PDF `DocFormat` members, `HtmlSaveOptions`,
  `MarkdownSaveOptions`, and `PrinterSettings` before writing anything.
- Documented the full inventory of unimplemented compatibility surfaces in
  `supported-features.md`.
- Extended the scheduled security audit to install and audit the `text-layout`
  extra (uharfbuzz, python-bidi, fonttools) alongside `images` and `woff2`, and
  made the minimal-install CI job assert those three modules are absent too, so
  every optional runtime dependency is covered by both gates.
- Added function-based PDF shadings with multidimensional sampled functions,
  shading matrix/domain/bounds/background handling, and Separation/DeviceN
  alternate-colour conversion.
- Replaced fixed patch-mesh tessellation with bounded device-scale-adaptive
  subdivision and added composite preview for common CMYK and spot overprint
  cases through `/OP`, `/op`, and `/OPM`.
- Corrected project metadata links and added minimal-install CI coverage.
- Added bounded fuzz targets and a redistributable parser corpus, replaced the
  skipped signature-extraction placeholder with an end-to-end test, and applied
  `PdfLoadLimits` to authored PNG and WOFF/WOFF2 decoding paths.
